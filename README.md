# Coordination repository for expansion of the Rust Reference

For more details on this work, see
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-project-goals/blob/main/src/2025h2/reference-expansion.md

This repository also contains a branch `reference` with a (roughly) up to date
version of the Rust Reference, for the purposes of draft-reviewable pull
requests.
